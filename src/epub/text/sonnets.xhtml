			<p>
				<span>From off a hill whose concave womb reworded</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A plaintful story from a sistering vale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My spirits to attend this double voice accorded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Storming her world with sorrow’s wind and rain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon her head a platted hive of straw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which fortified her visage from the sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The carcass of a beauty spent and done:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Time had not scythed all that youth begun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor youth all quit; but, spite of heaven’s fell rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some beauty peep’d through lattice of sear’d age.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which on it had conceited characters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laund’ring the silken figures in the brine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That seasoned woe had pelleted in tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And often reading what contents it bears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As often shrieking undistinguish’d woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In clamours of all size, both high and low.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sometimes her levell’d eyes their carriage ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As they did batt’ry to the spheres intend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To th’orbed earth; sometimes they do extend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their view right on; anon their gazes lend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To every place at once, and nowhere fix’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mind and sight distractedly commix’d.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Proclaim’d in her a careless hand of pride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For some untuck’d descended her sheav’d hat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, true to bondage, would not break from thence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though slackly braided in loose negligence.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A thousand favours from a maund she drew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which one by one she in a river threw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon whose weeping margent she was set,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like usury applying wet to wet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or monarch’s hands that lets not bounty fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of folded schedules had she many a one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which she perused, sigh’d, tore, and gave the flood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crack’d many a ring of posied gold and bone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found yet mo letters sadly penn’d in blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With sleided silk feat and affectedly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enswathed, and seal’d to curious secrecy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And often kiss’d, and often ’gan to tear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cried, “O false blood, thou register of lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What unapproved witness dost thou bear!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ink would have seem’d more black and damned here!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Big discontent so breaking their contents.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of court, of city, and had let go by</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The swiftest hours, observed as they flew⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, privileged by age, desires to know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So slides he down upon his grained bat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And comely-distant sits he by her side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he again desires her, being sat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her grievance with his hearing to divide:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If that from him there may be aught applied</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis promised in the charity of age.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Father,” she says, “though in me you behold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The injury of many a blasting hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let it not tell your judgement I am old;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I might as yet have been a spreading flower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fresh to myself, if I had self-applied</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love to myself and to no love beside.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But, woe is me! too early I attended</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A youthful suit⁠—it was to gain my grace⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of one by nature’s outwards so commended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That maidens’ eyes stuck over all his face:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love lack’d a dwelling, and made him her place;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when in his fair parts she did abide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She was new lodged and newly deified.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“His browny locks did hang in crooked curls;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every light occasion of the wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What’s sweet to do, to do will aptly find:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For on his visage was in little drawn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Small show of man was yet upon his chin;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His phoenix down began but to appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose bare out-bragg’d the web it seem’d to wear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet show’d his visage by that cost more dear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And nice affections wavering stood in doubt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If best were as it was, or best without.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“His qualities were beauteous as his form,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet if men moved him, was he such a storm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As oft ’twixt May and April is to see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When winds breathe sweet, unruly though they be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His rudeness so with his authorized youth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Well could he ride, and often men would say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘That horse his mettle from his rider takes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop he makes!’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And controversy hence a question takes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether the horse by him became his deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or he his manage by the well-doing steed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But quickly on this side the verdict went:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His real habitude gave life and grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To appertainings and to ornament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Accomplish’d in himself, not in his case:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came for additions; yet their purposed trim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pieced not his grace, but were all graced by him.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So on the tip of his subduing tongue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All kind of arguments and question deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All replication prompt, and reason strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For his advantage still did wake and sleep:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He had the dialect and different skill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Catching all passions in his craft of will:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That he did in the general bosom reign</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of young, of old; and sexes both enchanted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In personal duty, following where he haunted:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Consents bewitch’d, ere he desire, have granted;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dialogued for him what he would say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ask’d their own wills, and made their wills obey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Many there were that did his picture get,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like fools that in th’ imagination set</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The goodly objects which abroad they find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So many have, that never touch’d his hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My woeful self, that did in freedom stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And was my own fee-simple, not in part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What with his art in youth, and youth in art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Threw my affections in his charmed power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet did I not, as some my equals did,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finding myself in honour so forbid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With safest distance I mine honour shielded:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Experience for me many bulwarks builded</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain’d the foil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But ah, who ever shunn’d by precedent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The destined ill she must herself assay?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or forceed examples ’gainst her own content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To put the by-past perils in her way?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Counsel may stop a while what will not stay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when we rage, advice is often seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By blunting us to make our wills more keen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That we must curb it upon others’ proof;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be forbode the sweets that seems so good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O appetite, from judgement stand aloof!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The one a palate hath that needs will taste,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though Reason weep, and cry, ‘It is thy last.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For further I could say, ‘This man’s untrue,’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard where his plants in others’ orchards grew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thought characters and words merely but art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And long upon these terms I held my city,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till thus he ’gan besiege me: ‘Gentle maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And be not of my holy vows afraid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That’s to ye sworn, to none was ever said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For feasts of love I have been call’d unto,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till now did ne’er invite, nor never woo.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘All my offences that abroad you see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are errors of the blood, none of the mind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love made them not: with acture they may be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where neither party is nor true nor kind:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They sought their shame that so their shame did find;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so much less of shame in me remains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By how much of me their reproach contains.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Among the many that mine eyes have seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not one whose flame my heart so much as warm’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or my affection put to the smallest teen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or any of my leisures ever charm’d:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harm have I done to them, but ne’er was harm’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And reign’d commanding in his monarchy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Look here, what tributes wounded fancies sent me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of paled pearls and rubies red as blood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of grief and blushes, aptly understood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In bloodless white and the encrimson’d mood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Effects of terror and dear modesty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Encamp’d in hearts, but fighting outwardly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘And, lo, behold these talents of their hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With twisted metal amorously empleach’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have received from many a several fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the annexions of fair gems enrich’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And deep-brain’d sonnets that did amplify</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each stone’s dear nature, worth, and quality.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘The diamond⁠—why, ’twas beautiful and hard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereto his invised properties did tend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The deep green emerald, in whose fresh regard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With objects manifold: each several stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With wit well blazon’d, smiled or made some moan.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Lo, all these trophies of affections hot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of pensived and subdued desires the tender,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nature hath charged me that I hoard them not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But yield them up where I myself must render,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That is, to you, my origin and ender;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For these, of force, must your oblations be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since I their altar, you empatron me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘O, then, advance of yours that phraseless hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take all these similes to your own command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hallow’d with sighs that burning lungs did raise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What me your minister, for you obeys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Works under you; and to your audit comes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their distract parcels in combined sums.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or sister sanctified, of holiest note;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which late her noble suit in court did shun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But kept cold distance, and did thence remove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To spend her living in eternal love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘But, O my sweet, what labour is’t to leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The thing we have not, mastering what not strives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Playing the place which did no form receive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She that her fame so to herself contrives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The scars of battle ’scapeth by the flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And makes her absence valiant, not her might.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘O, pardon me, in that my boast is true:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The accident which brought me to her eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the moment did her force subdue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now she would the caged cloister fly:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Religious love put out Religion’s eye:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to be tempted, would she be immured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now, to tempt, all liberty procured.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘How mighty then you are, O, hear me tell!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The broken bosoms that to me belong</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have emptied all their fountains in my well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mine I pour your ocean all among:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I strong o’er them, and you o’er me being strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must for your victory us all congest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As compound love to physic your cold breast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘My parts had power to charm a sacred nun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, disciplined, ay, dieted in grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Believed her eyes when they to assail begun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All vows and consecrations giving place:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O most potential love! vow, bond, nor space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thou art all, and all things else are thine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘When thou impressest, what are precepts worth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How coldly those impediments stand forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love’s arms are peace, ’gainst rule, ’gainst sense, ’gainst shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sweetens, in the suffering pangs it bears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And supplicant their sighs to your extend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To leave the battery that you make ’gainst mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lending soft audience to my sweet design,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That shall prefer and undertake my troth.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This said, his watery eyes he did dismount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose sights till then were levell’d on my face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each cheek a river running from a fount</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With brinish current downward flow’d apace:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O, how the channel to the stream gave grace!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That flame through water which their hue encloses.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the small orb of one particular tear!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But with the inundation of the eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What rocky heart to water will not wear?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What breast so cold that is not warmed here?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For, lo, his passion, but an art of craft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even there resolved my reason into tears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There my white stole of chastity I daff’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shook off my sober guards and civil fears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Appear to him, as he to me appears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All melting; though our drops this difference bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His poison’d me, and mine did him restore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In him a plenitude of subtle matter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In either’s aptness, as it best deceives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To blush at speeches rank, to weep at woes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That not a heart which in his level came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could ’scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, veil’d in them, did win whom he would maim:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the thing he sought he would exclaim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he most burn’d in heart-wish’d luxury,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He preach’d pure maid, and prais’d cold chastity.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thus merely with the garment of a Grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The naked and concealed fiend he cover’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That th’ unexperient gave the tempter place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which like a cherubin above them hover’d.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, young and simple, would not be so lover’d?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay me! I fell; and yet do question make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What I should do again for such a sake.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O, that infected moisture of his eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O, that false fire which in his cheek so glow’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O, that forced thunder from his heart did fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O, that sad breath his spongy lungs bestow’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O, all that borrow’d motion seeming owed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would yet again betray the fore-betray’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And new pervert a reconciled maid!”</span>
